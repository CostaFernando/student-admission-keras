# Predicting Student Admissions with Neural Networks in Keras
This project is part of Udacity's Keras Lab.

In this notebook, we predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:
- GRE Scores (Test)
- GPA Scores (Grades)
- Class rank (1-4)

The dataset originally came from here: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/
